## Version Notes
> _**IMPORTANT!**_ If you have an opinion on how backwards compatibility should be achieved with new versions, please
> feel free to [drop a reply to this open discussion](https://github.com/SamJakob/SpiGUI/issues/21).

- I don't see a reason it shouldn't work in Spigot 1.7 or any version of Bukkit from 1.8 - 1.19 but it hasn't been tested on each individual version.
- This library has been tested on Spigot 1.8, Spigot 1.16 and PaperSpigot 1.19 and is expected to work on every versions in-between for most, if not all, forks of Spigot.
- The [ItemBuilder](https://github.com/SamJakob/SpiGUI/blob/master/src/main/java/com/samjakob/spigui/item/ItemBuilder.java) API does require that `api-version` be `"legacy"` (or not specified) for Spigot versions after 1.13.

## Quick Start

**Step 1: Create an instance of the SpiGUI library in your plugin**
```java

class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {

  public static SpiGUI spiGUI;
  
  @Override
  public void onEnable() {
    // (IMPORTANT!) Registers SpiGUI event handlers (and stores plugin-wide settings for SpiGUI.)
    spiGUI = new SpiGUI(this);
  }
  
}

```

<br>

**Step 2: Use the library**
```java
public void openMyAwesomeMenu(Player player) {

  // Create a GUI with 3 rows (27 slots)
  SGMenu myAwesomeMenu = MyPlugin.spiGUI.create("&cMy Awesome Menu", 3);

  // Create a button
  SGButton myAwesomeButton = new SGButton(
    // Includes an ItemBuilder class with chainable methods to easily
    // create menu items.
    new ItemBuilder(Material.WOOD).build()
  ).withListener((InventoryClickEvent event) -> {
    // Events are cancelled automatically, unless you turn it off
    // for your plugin or for this inventory.
    event.getWhoClicked().sendMessage("Hello, world!");
  });
  
  // Add the button to your GUI
  myAwesomeMenu.addButton(myAwesomeButton);
  
  // Show the GUI
  player.openInventory(myAwesomeMenu.getInventory());

}
```

**Step 3: Profit!**

## Why?
Chest Inventory Menus (commonly referred to as GUIs) are the ubiquitous way to display menus, execute actions and even manage configuration in Spigot plugins.
However, the Inventory API leveraged to achieve this in Spigot is not designed for menus, making code far more verbose and far less maintainable than it needs to be.

SpiGUI is a rewrite of my outdated [SpigotPaginatedGUI](https://github.com/masterdoctor/SpigotPaginatedGUI) API including improvements and features I've
added whilst using the API in my own software that aims to provide a highly readable and concise API for menus.
